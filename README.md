Hi there! I'm [Sandrina Pereira](https://www.sandrina-p.net/) and I belive that making the web accessible is one of our duties as web developers.

This is the resources for my [Web Acessibility Fundamentals Workshop](https://www.sandrina-p.net/workshop-a11y-fundamentals/).

## Pre-Workshop requirements

To get the most out of this workshop, please do the following things before the workshop:

- Install [Zoom](https://zoom.us) to join the video call.
  - Turn your video on if possible so we don't feel alone.
  - Keep your microphone muted to avoid background noises.
- Install a modern browser: Chrome or Firefox are recommended.
- Familiarize yourself with the basics of a screen reader (SR). You only need to learn the basics of navigation through a webpage.

The more prepared you are for the workshop, the better it will go for you!
