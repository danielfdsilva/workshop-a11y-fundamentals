<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Nowadays it's very common to interact with pieces of UI where the content changes immediately after we click on it.</p>
<p>For example, the "like button" or "toggle dark theme". This is an action that happens immediately, without a middle step to confirm that action. That's the opposite of a traditional form submit.</p>
<p>Should that affect how we use/create those interfaces? Let's explore‚Ä¶</p>
<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>
<p>In the <a href="../exercises/4.2.html">exercise page</a>,
there is a layout with a few "toggle settings" that are applied immediately after change (without a submit button).</p>
<p>Visually, it's perceiveable the options available before we click (activate) them. What about people who use only the keyboard or a screen reader?</p>
<p><strong>üéØ Goal:</strong> Improve the accessibility of each setting.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Each case might have multiple solutions. It's totally okay if your own solution is different from the one proposed.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion for QA & designers:</strong><br />
This exercise will require a good chunk of code changes. It's totally fine if you don't feel comfortable with it.<br />
As an alternative, I suggest you to write down a list of the things that need to be improved, and, perhaps pair up with your group to collaborate together!</p>

<summary>üçÄ Tips about moments of actions</summary></p>
<p>One of the differences between a form control and a button is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Form controls (e.g. inputs) are meant to receive and carry a value. These values are editable and should not take effect until we explicit submit them.</li>
<li>Buttons are expected to take immediate action upon activation.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's the main question we should ask ourselves when building an interactive element:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the selection, takes immediate effect? Then, it's a button.</li>
<li>Does the selection requires confirmation? Then it's a form control.</li>
</ul>
<p>üçÄ The way a funcionality is presented might misslead us to change its foundations. We need to be mindful about this thin layer between UX and semantics.</p>

<summary>üçÄ Tips about dynamic names and states</summary></p>
<p>When we interact with "Sound toggle" using a screen reader, two things happen when pressing it:</p>
<ul>
<li>The button label changes</li>
<li>The <code>aria-pressed</code> values changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a screen reader, changing both <em>name</em> and <em>status</em> can be confusing when the toggle is not active.</p>
<ul>
<li>Voice Over: <em>selected, Sound on, toggle button</em></li>
<li>Voice Over: <em>unselected, Sound off, toggle button</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If the "sound off" is "unselected", it means the sound is actually turned on. Confusing right?</p>
<p>Here's an example, much clear for screen readers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Voice Over: <em>selected, Enable sound, toggle button</em></li>
<li>Voice Over: <em>unselected, Enable sound, toggle button</em></li>
</ul>
<p>üçÄ When labeling dynamic elements, never change both label and state at the same time. Stick with one of them.</p>

<summary>üçÄ Tips about keyboard navigation</summary></p>
<p>Although <code>Tab</code> is the main way to navigate between interactive elements, it's not the only one. In some cases the navigation is done with arrow keys (e.g <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> radio/checkboxes). We can even create our custom shortcuts.</p>
<p>We might ask: When to use Tabs or Arrow Keys?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#kbd_shortcuts">WAI keyboard guidelines</a> are extended and a continuous work in progress. This is my current simplified decision tree:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skip Tabs to make navigation more efficient. (Google Drive is a great example)</li>
<li>Use Arrow keys when elements are directly related (eg a toolbox,a breadcrumb)</li>
<li>When using Arrow keys, highligh visually the parent element, for a clear understanding of the context and related elements.</li>
<li>The direction mechanism to move between elements depends on the context. <code>aria-describedby</code> with instructions can be helpful for blind people.</li>
</ul>
