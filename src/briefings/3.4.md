# 3.4. Accessible forms

## Introduction

When talking about the accessibility of a form, usually we are talking about their accessibility regarding people who use screen readers or keyboards. However **everyone benefits from a well-organized and usable form**, especially those with cognitive disabilities. Forms should be clear and intuitive.

When building forms, we need to ensure that:

- Every form control has a label
- Required fields are explicit
- Requirements / errors are understandable
- Forms are navigatable by keyboard

First things first, a form control must always have a respective label.

```html
<!-- Option A: Use for and id to connect both elements -->
<label for="uName">Name</label>
<input type="text" id="uName" />

<!-- Option B: Wrap the text and the input in a <label>.
  The browser will connect both. -->
<label>
  <span>Name</span>
  <input type="text" />
</label>
```

If we ensure these labels in every form element, it's already a half way done!

## Exercise

In the [exercise page](../exercises/3.4.html), there are a few form controls. Each one has a particular accessibility issue.

**üéØ Goal:** Make the form accessible for keyboard and screen readers.

**Hint 1:** SR users usually [prefer to fill forms using `Tab` key](https://twitter.com/a_sandrina_p/status/1382811701796614148). Do the same to detect A11Y issues.

**Hint 2:** Use the Accessibility Tree tab on DevTools, to know how a form control is announced.

## Bonus

### #1 Form feedback

When submitting the form, a feedback message is displayed, based on the submission result (success or invalid).

Although these changes are perceivable to those who can see the page, that's not the case for those who use a screen reader.

**üéØ Goal:** Ensure the form feedback is announced by A.T. tools.

<details>
<summary>üçÄ Toggle hint</summary>

The solution is similar to the previous exercise, using live regions.

### #2 Better input numbers

In one of the fields, we used `type="number"` to benefit from
virtual keyboard. However, that approach still has some A11Y issues that can be overcomed with another strategy:

```html
<input type="text" inputmode="numeric" pattern="^[0-9.]*$" />
```

That pattern accepts numbers and dots (eg 10, 15.50).

### #3 Using buttons inside forms

_This is already done, but let me explain this common form mistake:_

1. Go to the exercise page, to both `<button>` elements and remove `type` attribute.

This creates 2 bugs:

- Press the password's visibility button (by mouse or keyboard). The form is also submitted (check the logs in the console).
- Press "Enter" in any input, the password is also toggled.

**Why does that happen?**

The default type of a `<button>` is `"submit"`.
When a button inside a `<form>` is clicked, the form will look for the first "submit" button and trigger it.
In this form, the first button is the password toggle. That's why when we click it, it submits the form too.

**Takeaway:** Always explicit the button type (`type="button"` or `type="submit"`) when used inside forms to avoid unwanted form submissions.
