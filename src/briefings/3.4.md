# 3.4. Meaningful content - extras

## Introduction

Until now, we have been exploring fairly simple cases, but let me tell you something:

When it comes to accessibility, there isn't one single right way to do most of stuff. Once you find a solution, look for other solutions.

Each approach has positive and negative consequences. We should aim for understanding their impacts and assume the trade-offs rather than pretending they don't exist.

## Exercise

In the [exercise page](../exercises/3.4.html),
there are a few more common cases not accessible. Each one might have multiple solutions and trade-offs.

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal:** Improve the accessibility of each case.

### #1 Custom select

A custom accessible select is one of the trickiest things to create. Short answer: **Avoid them if you can**. But letâ€™s face reality: a custom select is still our best solution sometimes.

There's a relative simple technique to enhance these custom selects. I named this a _"hybrid select"_. It consists of 2 selects:

- A native select, visible and accessible by default
- A custom select, hidden until itâ€™s safe to be interacted with a mouse

The trick is to show each one at the right moment:

```css
/* show the custom select only on devices with hovers (aka mouse) */

.selectCustom {
  display: none;
}
@media (hover: hover) {
  .selectCustom {
    display: block;
  }

  /* In a computer, but using the keyboard?
  Then hide the custom select when the native is focused: */
  .selectNative:focus + .selectCustom {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal:** Refactor the select to be a "hybrid select".

**Important:** This select still has A11Y issues. This is a "partial solution" of a bigger ["hybrid select" experiment](https://css-tricks.com/striking-a-balance-between-native-and-custom-select-elements/). If you use this in the future, please take into considerations its limitations.
