# 3.4. Meaningful content - extras

## Introduction

Until now, we have been exploring fairly simple cases, but let me tell you something:

When it comes to accessibility, there isn't one single right way to do most of stuff. Once you find a solution, look for other solutions.

Each approach has positive and negative consequences. We should **aim for understanding their impacts and assume the trade-offs** rather than pretending they don't exist.

## Exercise

In the [exercise page](../exercises/3.4.html),
there are a few more common cases not accessible.

**üéØ Goal:** Improve the accessibility of each case.

Each case might have multiple solutions. For that reason, you won't find a "direct" suggestion/solution like on the exercises before.

Instead, I encourage you to study each case and **come up with your own audits.** Below you can find some hints and _food for thought_.

## üçÄ Hints (try before reading!)

### Lesson #1 - Lists

Visually, it's perceivable what's the current element in the list,
however that's not true for blind people. Here it comes `aria-current`.

**Note:** Chrome does not support it yet, but Firefox and Safari do!

### Lesson #2 Clickable cards

You notice the cards are totally clicable - with touch, mouse and keyboard. Here's some things for you to consider:

Try read it with screen reader....

- If you jump directly to the title and read after it, you won't notice the video category/date.
- Does the date announcement sounds right?

Try to select the card text. (eg try to copy the title). Could you do it?

### Lesson #3 - Custom select

A custom accessible select is one of the trickiest things to create.

Among many studies (read references bellwo) around selects, I can give you the short answer: **Avoid selectors if you can**. But let‚Äôs face reality: a custom select is still our best solution sometimes.

There's a relative simple technique to enhance these custom selects. I personally named this a _"hybrid select"_. It consists of 2 selects:

- A native select, visible and accessible by default
- A custom select, hidden until it‚Äôs safe to be interacted with a mouse

The trick is to show each one at the right moment:

```css
/* show the custom select only on devices with hovers (aka mouse) */

.selectCustom {
  display: none;
}
@media (hover: hover) {
  .selectCustom {
    display: block;
  }

  /* In a computer, but using the keyboard?
  Then hide the custom select when the native is focused: */
  .selectNative:focus + .selectCustom {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

**Important:** This still has A11Y issues. It's a partial solution of a bigger ["hybrid select" experiment](https://css-tricks.com/striking-a-balance-between-native-and-custom-select-elements/). If you use this in the future, please take into considerations its limitations.
