<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Until now, we have been exploring fairly simple cases, but let me tell you something:</p>
<p>When it comes to accessibility, there isn't one single right way to do most of stuff. Once you find a solution, look for other solutions.</p>
<p>Each approach has positive and negative consequences. We should <strong>aim for understanding their impacts and assume the trade-offs</strong> rather than pretending they don't exist.</p>
<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>
<p>In the <a href="../exercises/3.4.html">exercise page</a>,
there are a few more common cases not accessible.</p>
<p><strong>üéØ Goal:</strong> Improve the accessibility of each case.</p>
<p>Each case might have multiple solutions. For that reason, you won't find a "direct" suggestion/solution like on the exercises before.</p>
<p>Instead, I encourage you to study each case and <strong>come up with your own audits.</strong> Below you can find some hints and <em>food for thought</em>.</p>
<h2 id="hintstrybeforereading">üçÄ Hints (try before reading!)</h2>
<h3 id="lesson1lists">Lesson #1 - Lists</h3>
<p>Visually, it's perceivable what's the current element in the list,
however that's not true for blind people. Here it comes <code>aria-current</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Chrome does not support it yet, but Firefox and Safari do!</p>

<h3 id="lesson2clickablecards">Lesson #2 Clickable cards</h3>
<p>You notice the cards are totally clicable - with touch, mouse and keyboard. Here's some things for you to consider:</p>
<p>Try read it with screen reader‚Ä¶.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you jump directly to the title and read after it, you won't notice the video category/date.</li>
<li>Does the date announcement sounds right?</li>
</ul>
<p>Try to select the card text. (eg try to copy the title). Could you do it?</p>

<h3 id="lesson3customselect">Lesson #3 - Custom select</h3>
<p>A custom accessible select is one of the trickiest things to create.</p>
<p>Among many studies (read references bellwo) around selects, I can give you the short answer: <strong>Avoid selectors if you can</strong>. But let‚Äôs face reality: a custom select is still our best solution sometimes.</p>
<p>There's a relative simple technique to enhance these custom selects. I personally named this a <em>"hybrid select"</em>. It consists of 2 selects:</p>
<ul>
<li>A native select, visible and accessible by default</li>
<li>A custom select, hidden until it‚Äôs safe to be interacted with a mouse</li>
</ul>
<p>The trick is to show each one at the right moment:</p>
<pre><code class="css language-css">/* show the custom select only on devices with hovers (aka mouse) */

.selectCustom {
  display: none;
}
@media (hover: hover) {
  .selectCustom {
    display: block;
  }

  /* In a computer, but using the keyboard?
  Then hide the custom select when the native is focused: */
  .selectNative:focus + .selectCustom {
    display: none;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> This still has A11Y issues. It's a partial solution of a bigger <a href="https://css-tricks.com/striking-a-balance-between-native-and-custom-select-elements/">"hybrid select" experiment</a>. If you use this in the future, please take into considerations its limitations.</p>
