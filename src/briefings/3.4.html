<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Until now, we have been exploring fairly simple cases, but let me tell you something:</p>
<p>When it comes to accessibility, there isn't one single right way to do most of stuff. Once you find a solution, look for other solutions.</p>
<p>Each approach has positive and negative consequences. We should aim for understanding their impacts and assume the trade-offs rather than pretending they don't exist.</p>
<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>
<p>In the <a href="../exercises/3.4.html">exercise page</a>,
there are a few more common cases not accessible. Each one might have multiple solutions and trade-offs.</p>
<p><strong>ðŸŽ¯ Goal:</strong> Improve the accessibility of each case.</p>
<h2 id="bonus">Bonus</h2>
<h3 id="1customselect">#1 Custom select</h3>
<p>A custom accessible select is one of the trickiest things to create. Short answer: <strong>Avoid them if you can</strong>. But letâ€™s face reality: a custom select is still our best solution sometimes.</p>
<p>There's a relative simple technique to enhance these custom selects. I named this a <em>"hybrid select"</em>. It consists of 2 selects:</p>
<ul>
<li>A native select, visible and accessible by default</li>
<li>A custom select, hidden until itâ€™s safe to be interacted with a mouse</li>
</ul>
<p>The trick is to show each one at the right moment:</p>
<pre><code class="css language-css">/* show the custom select only on devices with hovers (aka mouse) */

.selectCustom {
  display: none;
}
@media (hover: hover) {
  .selectCustom {
    display: block;
  }

  /* In a computer, but using the keyboard?
  Then hide the custom select when the native is focused: */
  .selectNative:focus + .selectCustom {
    display: none;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>ðŸŽ¯ Goal:</strong> Refactor the select to be a "hybrid select".</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> This select still has A11Y issues. This is a "partial solution" of a bigger <a href="https://css-tricks.com/striking-a-balance-between-native-and-custom-select-elements/">"hybrid select" experiment</a>. If you use this in the future, please take into considerations its limitations.</p>
