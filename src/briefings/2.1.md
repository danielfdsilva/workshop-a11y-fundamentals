# Interactive elements

## Introduction

Many users, especially people with motor disabilities or visual disabilities, rely on a keyboard to navigate the web. These people need **visual focus indicators** to enjoy the web.

It is common to hide the default focus indicator [because it's ugly](../assets/imgs/browser-focus.png) and [different across browsers](https://allyjs.io/tests/focus-outline-styles/#style=focus&key=text,radio,checkbox,textarea,button,link,div&browser=firefox,chrome,safari,ie11). That's okay, though. What isn't okay is to not build an alternative.

We must provide accessible focus states on our apps.

```css
button:focus {
  /* It's okay to do this... */
  outline: none;

  /* ...if we build a custom indicator */
  box-shadow: 0 0 3px 3px tomato;
}
```

## Exercise

In the [exercise page](../exercises/2.1.html),
there are a couple of interactive elements. However, we can't easily access them through the keyboard.

**üéØ Goal:** Make all interactive elements accessible by keyboard with `:hover` and `:focus`.

**üçÄ Tip:** You can use `Tab` and `Shift + Tab` to go forward and backward respectively across the interactive elements.

There aren't any explicit design requirements, so you can go _free-style_!
Adding some opacity or changing the color are common design approaches.

**Safari Note:** By default `Tab` doesn't work on links and buttons. Activate those in _Settings > Advanced > [‚úì] Press tab to highlight each item on a web page_.

## Bonus

### #1.1 Focus only when using the keyboard

Another reason to hide the focus indicator on buttons and links is that the focus is triggered when clicking them.

We can ignore the focus when using the mouse and show it only when using the keyboard, using [`:focus-visible`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible) comes in!

```css
/* Remove the outline for mouse users with modern browsers */
button:focus:not(:focus-visible) {
  outline: none;
}

/* Add the focus indicator when interacted with keyboard */
button:focus-visible {
  outline: 3px solid tomato;
}
```

**üéØ Goal:** Add `:focus-visible` to the interactive elements.

<details>
<summary>üçÄ Toggle hint about inputs</summary>

In inputs the focus-visible is always triggered, even on click. That's not a bug, but rather the [spec's expected behavior](https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible/issues/131).

> UA (Browser User Agents) typically display focus indicators on text fields any time they‚Äôre focused, to draw attention to the fact that keyboard input will affect their contents.

#### #1.2 Focus across browsers

Some browsers do not support `:focus-visible` yet (eg Safari). So, for full support we need use the polyfill [focus-visible.js](https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible) instead.

```html
<!-- Include the polyfill at the bottom of the page -->
<script src="../assets/polyfill-focus-visible.js"></script>
```

```css
/* Hide the focus after the polyfill is added */
.js-focus-visible button:focus {
  outline: none;
}

/* Show the focus when interacted with keyboard */
.js-focus-visible button:focus.focus-visible {
  outline: 3px solid tomato;
}
```

**üéØ Goal:** Refactor the focus to include the `focus-visible.js` polyfill.

**üçÄ Tip:** When using styles dependent on JS, take into account websites without JS. The prefix `.js-focus-visible` ensures we only customize the focus if the polyfill is working, leaving the default one intact in case the JS doesn't load.

### #2 Styling based on child focus

Imagine a new design requirement to the input field:

- When focusing the input, the text "Nickname" turns purple.

There's a CSS pseudo-selector that allow us to style an element when it contains a focused element. It's called [`:focus-within`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-within#css)

**üéØ Goal:** Use `:focus-within` to solve the new design requirement.

**üçÄ Tip:** When using styles dependent on JavaScript, take into account websites without Javascript.
