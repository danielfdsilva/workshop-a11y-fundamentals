# 4.1. More meaningful content

## Introduction

Until now, we have been exploring fairly simple cases, but let me tell you something:

When it comes to accessibility, there isn't one single right way to solve a scenario. Each approach has positive and negative consequences. Once you find a solution, look for other solutions and balance them. We should **aim for understanding their impacts and assume the trade-offs** rather than pretending they don't exist.

## Exercise

In the [exercise page](../exercises/4.1.html),
there are a few more common cases not accessible.

Each case might have multiple solutions. That's why you won't find a direct suggestion of solution as in the previous exercises.

**üéØ Goal:** Improve the accessibility of each case.

**Suggestion for QA & designers:**
These cases will require a good chunk of code changes. It's totally fine if you don't feel comfortable with code. As an alternative, I suggest you to write down a requirements list, pointing what is not right or what can be improved.

## Hints

I encourage you to explore and come up with your own audits before reading further. Below you can find some hints and _food for thought_ about each case.

### Case #1 - Lists

Visually, it's perceivable which list item is the current one. However, that's not true for blind people. Perhaps, Some [ARIA attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#state_prop_def) that reflects the _current_ state.

### Case #2 - Clickable cards

You notice the cards are totally clickable - with touch, mouse and keyboard. Some things for you to consider:

Try to read it with screen reader....

- If you jump directly to the title and keep reading, you won't notice the video category/date.
- Does the date announcement sound right?
- Try to highlight the card text. (eg select and copy the title). Could you do it?

### Case #3 - Custom select

A custom accessible `<select>` is one of the hardest things to create.

Among many studies (read references bellow) around selects, I can give you the short answer: **Avoid selectors if you can**. But let‚Äôs face reality: a custom select is still our best solution sometimes.

There's a relative simple technique to enhance these custom selects. I personally named this a _"hybrid select"_. It consists of 2 selects:

- A native select, visible and accessible by default
- A custom select, hidden until it‚Äôs safe to be interacted with a mouse

The trick is to show each one at the right moment:

```css
/* show the custom select only on devices with hovers (aka mouse) */

.selectCustom {
  display: none;
}
@media (hover: hover) {
  .selectCustom {
    display: block;
  }

  /* In a computer, but using the keyboard?
  Then hide the custom select when the native is focused: */
  .selectNative:focus + .selectCustom {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

**Important:** This still has A11Y issues. It's a partial solution of a bigger ["hybrid select" experiment](https://css-tricks.com/striking-a-balance-between-native-and-custom-select-elements/). If you use this in the future, please take into consideration its limitations.

### Case #4 - Toggle Buttons

Some questions for you to think about:

- What makes a button, a button?
- What's the difference between a button and an input checkbox/radio?
- When you interact with these elements, do you expect the action to be taken immediately, or not?

Give it some thought...

<summary>Tips about dynamic names and states</summary>

When we interact with "Sound toggle" using a screen reader, two things happen when pressing it:

- The button label changes
- The `aria-pressed` values changes.

For a screen reader, changing both _name_ and _status_ can be confusing when the toggle is not active.

- Voice Over: _selected, Sound on, toggle button_
- Voice Over: _unselected, Sound off, toggle button_

If the "sound off" is "unselected", it means the sound is actually turned on. Confusing right?

Here's an example, much clear for screen readers:

- Voice Over: _selected, Enable sound, toggle button_
- Voice Over: _unselected, Enable sound, toggle button_

üçÄ When labeling dynamic elements, never change both label and state at the same time. Stick with one of them.

<summary>Tips about moments of actions</summary>

One of the differences between a form control and a button is:

- Form controls (e.g. inputs) are meant to receive and carry a value. These values are editable and should not take effect until we explicit submit them.
- Buttons are expected to take immediate action upon activation.

That's the main question we should ask ourselves when building an interactive element:

- Does the selection, takes immediate effect? Then, it's a button.
- Does the selection requires confirmation? Then it's a form control.

üçÄ The way a funcionality is presented might misslead us to change its foundations. We need to be mindful about this thin layer between UX and semantics.

<summary>Tips about keyboard navigation</summary>

Although `Tab` is the main way to navigate between interactive elements, it's not the only one. In some cases the navigation is done with arrow keys (e.g `<select>` and `<input>` radio/checkboxes). We can even create our custom shortcuts.

We might ask: When to use Tabs or Arrow Keys?

The [WAI keyboard guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#kbd_shortcuts) are extended and a continuos work in progress. This is my current simplified decision tree:

- Skip Tabs to make navigation more efficient. (Google Drive is a great example)
- Use Arrow keys when elements are directly related (eg a toolbox,a breadcrumb)
- When using Arrow keys, highligh visually the parent element, for a clear understanding of the context and related elements.
- The direction mechanism to move between elements depends on the context. `aria-describedby` with instructions can be helpful for blind people.

### Case #5 - Loading states

When some content is being processed, we use visual indicators to assure users that their request is being taken care of.

These indicators besides being visual, need to be effective for people using keyboard and screen readers as well.

Some things for you to consider:

- Using keyboard only, can you navigate correctly while the lucky numbers are being loaded?
- Using the screen reader, are you aware of when the content gets loaded?
