# 4.1. Loading states

## Introduction

Until now, we have been exploring fairly simple cases, but there are some patterns that are all but straightforward:

In A11Y, some patterns may have multiple solutions. Each approach has positive and negative consequences. Once you find a solution, look for other solutions and balance them. We should **aim for understanding their impacts and assume the trade-offs** rather than pretending they don't exist.

Nowadays [loading skeletons](https://uxdesign.cc/what-you-should-know-about-skeleton-screens-a820c45a571a) are everywhere to inform the user that the page or some part of it is being loaded.

These are perceivable visually but the same ain't true for the people with vision impairment.

## Exercise

In the [exercise page](../exercises/4.1.html),
there is a dummy search mechanism that loads a set of results.

Visually it's perceivable when the result is being loaded and when it's finished. But what about people using screen readers. How can we do it?

**üéØ Goal:** Improve the accessibility of the loading state for people with visual impairments.

<summary>üçÄ Toggle hint #1:</summary>

We already learned about Live Regions using `aria-live`. Using those, remember to announce both loading states:

1. When the result start to be loaded (The visual message "Products loading...")
2. When the result is ready.

<summary>üçÄ Toggle hint #2:</summary>

The designs don't include a visual message, but we can still add that using a visually hidden element. Remember `.sr-only`? It's the perfect time to use it!

## Bonus #1

Using the cursor, you may have noticed that a tooltip is shown on button hover. Now, try to do the same using the keyboard only.

That's not possilbe because the button is disabled using `disabled` attribute. How can we solve this? Prevent the click interaction, but still allowing the focus interaction.

<details>
<summary>üçÄ Toggle hint #1:</summary>
There is an attribute `aria-disabled="true"` that we can use.

Semantically it marks the button as disabled, but it does not change the behavior. In other words, you can still focus it using the keyboard.

</details>

<details>
<summary>üçÄ Toggle hint #2:</summary>
ARIA only purpose is to add extra semantics to an element. It never, _ever_ changes the styles or behavior of that element.

That means, you need to manually prevent the click and change the CSS styles when that attribute is presented.
