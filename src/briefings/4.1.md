# 4.1. Loading states

## Introduction

Until now, we have been exploring fairly simple cases, but there are some patterns that are all but straightforward:

In A11Y, some patterns may have multiple solutions. Each approach has positive and negative consequences. Once you find a solution, look for other solutions and balance them. We should **aim for understanding their impacts and assume the trade-offs** rather than pretending they don't exist.

Nowadays [loading skeletons](https://uxdesign.cc/what-you-should-know-about-skeleton-screens-a820c45a571a) are everywhere to inform the user that the page or some part of it is being loaded.

These are perceivable visually but the same ain't true for the people with vision impairment.

## Exercise

In the [exercise page](../exercises/4.1.html),
there is a dummy search mechanism that loads a set of results.

**üéØ Goal:** Improve the accessibility of the loading state for people with visual impairments.

üçÄ Some things for you to consider:

- Using the screen reader, are you aware of when the content gets loaded?
- Using only the keyboard, can you navigate correctly while the lucky numbers are being loaded?

  <summary>üçÄ Reveal solution</summary>
  - Replace `disabled` with `aria-disabled` to avoid skipping focus.
  - Add `aria-live` to the loading element to announce when it starts/ends.
  - Add `aria-busy` to the content while it's being loaded. (not well supported yet).
