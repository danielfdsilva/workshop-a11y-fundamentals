# 3.2. Page Landmarks

## Introduction

Here's a myth: _"People using screen readers read all the text."_ Not true. We are all the same: we scan the page looking for keywords until something catches our attention. Only then, we start to actually read it.

Screen Readers users usually navigate the page through _headings_ and _landmarks_. We already know the importance of a solid heading structure. Now let's talk about landmarks.

Landmarks identify sections of a page, which allows SR users to orient themselves in the page and jump directly to them.

Some elements are landmarks by default, such as `<main>` and `<nav>`. However, in many cases, we need to explicitly add a [landmark role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques#Landmark_roles).

```html
<!-- It's sounds redundant but it's needed! -->
<header role="banner">...</header>

<!-- An extra label should be added when a
landmark is used multiple times. -->
<nav aria-label="website">...</nav>
<nav aria-label="T.O.C.">...</nav>
```

## Exercise

In the [exercise page](../exercises/3.2.html),
there are at least four landmarks besides the main content: the primary navigation, the search, a custom landmark and another navigation on the bottom of the page.

**üéØ Goal:** Specify each landmark using `role` attribute.

**Hint:** You can detect the page landmarks in multiple ways:

- Screen Reader: [(check SR shortcuts)](https://dequeuniversity.com/screenreaders/survival-guide)
  - VoiceOver: Open the router with `VO + U`
- Extensions: _Accessibility Insights_ or [Landmarks extension](http://matatk.agrip.org.uk/landmarks/)\.

## Bonus

### #1 Language of the page

Use a SR to read the "Good morning" part. You'll notice that it's not pronounced correctly in the three idioms presented. This is a very annoying issue for SR users who visit a page in a language different from their system settings.

To fix it, the `lang` attribute needs to be added to the element that contains a different idiom.

```html
<!-- "Hello world!" in Portuguese -->
<p lang="pt-PT">Ol√° mundo</p>
```

**üéØ Goal:** Add the idiom of any different content.

**üçÄ Tip:** Here's a list of all [ISO Language Codes](http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm) to help you.

_Note: that all pages in this workshop have `<html lang="en">` for convenience._

### #2 Content hierarchy and relations

You might be aware of `<section>` and `<article>` tags and wondering when to use each other.
There's no better way to discover it than by using it yourself with a screen reader.

**üéØ Goal:** Experiment replacing some of the `<div>` that mark areas/blocks of the page with `section` or `article`. Listen how a screen reader announce them differently.

**üçÄ Tip:** Use `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` to give a name to that area.
