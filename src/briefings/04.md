# Interactive elements

## Motivation

Keyboard accessibility is one of the most important aspects of web accessibility. Many users, especially people with motor disabilities and blind people rely on a keyboard to navigate through the web. These people need an **accessible focus indicators** to enjoy the web.

A very common practice is to hide the default focus indicator [because it's ugly](../assets/browser-focus.png). And that's okay. The mistake is to not create a custom one. **We must include accessible focus states on our design.**

```css
button:focus {
  /* It's okay to do this... */
  outline: none;

  /* ...if we build a custom indicator: */
  box-shadow: 0 0 3px 3px tomato;
}
```

## Exercise

Here's a page with a bunch of interactive elements: links, buttons and form controls. However, we can't easily access them through keyboard.

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal:** Make all interactive elements accessible by keyboard.

## Bonus

### 1. Focus only when using keyboard

The main reason to hide the focus indicator is because it's triggered when we click the element. What if we could activate `:focus` only when using the keyboard and ignore it when using the mouse? That's where `:focus-visible` comes in! [See MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible).

Most browsers don't support it yet, but there's a polyfill: [focus-visible.js](https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible)

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal:** Add `focus-visible` to the page and update `:focus` styles to use focus-visible.

```html
<!-- Include the polyfill at the bottom of the page -->
<script src="../assets/focus-visible.js"></script>
```

```css
/*
  This will hide the focus indicator if the element
  receives focus via the mouse, but it will still
  show up on keyboard focus.
*/
button:focus:not(.focus-visible) {
  outline: none;
  box-shadow: 0 0 3px 3px tomato;
}
```

### 2. Custom interactive elements

// CONTINUE HERE...

```css
.select:focus {
  opacity: 1;
}

.select:focus + .selectNative {
  display: none;
}
```
