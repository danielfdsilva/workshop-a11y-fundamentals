    <h1 id="1asemantichtml">1.1 Semantic HTML</h1>
    <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
    <p>Web standards are rules and guidelines used to promote code consistency when building a web page. We should
      follow these standards so that anyone (people and robots) can access and understand a webpage content properly, in
      a meaningful way.</p>
    <p>One of the Web standards is to write semantic HTML markup: Go beyond <code>&lt;div /&gt;</code> and
      <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> (non-semantic elements) and replace them by <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">semantics elements</a>. Use them where it makes
      sense: to describe sections, text, media, and so on. This way, we are not only writing <strong>readable
        code</strong>, but we also making the a more <strong>accessible place</strong>.</p>
    <h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>
    <p>Your colleague implemented a page and the designer approved it because it looks as expected!
      However, under the hood, if we see the page naked (without CSS styles), it doesn't
      make much sense. People who read this page through a <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Screen_reader">Screen Reader</a> won't understand it
      properly.</p>
    <p><strong>ðŸŽ¯ Goal:</strong> Improve the HTML by using semantic elements.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can start by removing the styles and try to read the page as if it was a book. Plain
      old text. Improve the HTML until this book makes sense to you.</p>
    <h2 id="bonus">Bonus</h2>
    <p>Did you finish it on time? Don't stop now, here's some extra challenges for you:</p>
    <h3 id="1orderofcontent">1. Order of content</h3>
    <p>In a book, the title is always the first thing to show up. However, in this page, the tag "Limited edition"
      appears before the title. Your goal is to <em>reorder the HTML elements</em> so the title and the tag appear on
      the correct order. But the design should not change! How can we do it? Perhaps some flexbox trick can help us to
      <em>reverse the order</em> visually?</p>
    <h3 id="2missingcontent">2. Missing content</h3>
    <p>In this page we can visually understand that the plant is on sale ($40 to $30). However, if we see the page naked
      (without styles), it doesn't make much sense. We see 2 amounts but we don't know the difference between them. Some
      people may not even understand that's the plant price! Your goal is to add the missing words and hide them
      visually when the page is displayed with styles.</p>
    <pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;span class="visually-hidden"&gt;Price:&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> What CSS will you use at <code>.visually-hidden</code>? There are <a
        href="https://a11yproject.com/posts/how-to-hide-content/">better ways to hide content</a>, than using
      <code>display: none;</code>!</p>
    <h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
    <p><strong>Did you know?</strong> There's a global <a href="https://css-naked-day.github.io/">CSS naked day</a> on
      April 9. In this day, developers release their websites without styles, showing only the HTML behind it. The idea
      behind this event is to promote Web Standards. This includes proper use of HTML, semantic markup, a good hierarchy
      structure, and of course, a good old play on words.</p>
