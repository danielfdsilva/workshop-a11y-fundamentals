# 4.2. UI Patterns collection

## Introduction

So far, you've learned that creating accessible websites isn't as hard as it sounds. Most of the UI can be fully accessible through native HTML elements and a couple of `ARIA` attributes.

The modern web experiences have been evolving way faster than the languages available (HTML). We don't have yet a `<tooltip>`, `<modal>` or `<tabs>` native elements, so we need to find our way around with the existing tools. I'll be truly honest with you: **building custom UI patterns fully accessible is harder than it looks like.**

Because of that, when I need to implement a new component that doesn't exist as an `HTML` element, **I use existing solutions from the community** instead of reinventing the wheel and risking creating a experience that doesn't work for everyone.

I recommend you to do the same. Here's a personal accurated list of the common patterns:

## Libraries

- [Reach UI](https://reach.tech/) - A headless accessible foundation of your React-based design system.
- [React ARIA](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html) - A library of React hooks that provides accessible UI primitives for your design system.
