<h1 id="41moremeaningfulcontent">4.1. More meaningful content</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Until now, we have been exploring fairly simple cases, but let me tell you something:</p>
<p>When it comes to accessibility, there isn't one single right way to solve a scenario. Each approach has positive and negative consequences. Once you find a solution, look for other solutions and balance them. We should <strong>aim for understanding their impacts and assume the trade-offs</strong> rather than pretending they don't exist.</p>
<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>
<p>In the <a href="../exercises/4.1.html">exercise page</a>,
there are a few more common cases not accessible.</p>
<p>Each case might have multiple solutions. That's why you won't find a direct suggestion of a solution as in the previous exercises.</p>
<p><strong>üéØ Goal:</strong> Improve the accessibility of each case.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion for QA & designers:</strong>
These cases will require a good chunk of code changes. It's totally fine if you don't feel comfortable with code. As an alternative, I suggest you to write down a list of what's not correct or what can be improved.</p>
<h2 id="hints">Hints</h2>
<p>Below you can find some hints and <em>food for thought</em> about each case.</p>

<h3 id="case1loadingstates">Case #1 - Loading states</h3>
<p>We use visual indicators to assure users that some request is being processed.</p>
<p>These indicators need to be effective for people with vision impairment as well.</p>
<p>Some things for you to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the screen reader, are you aware of when the content gets loaded?</li>
<li>Using keyboard only, can you navigate correctly while the lucky numbers are being loaded?</li>
</ul>
<p><details>
  <summary>üçÄ Reveal solution</summary></p>
<ul>
<li>Replace <code>disabled</code> with <code>aria-disabled</code> to avoid skipping focus.</li>
<li>Add <code>aria-live</code> to the loading element no announce when it starts/ends.</li>
<li>Add <code>aria-busy</code> to the content while it's being loaded. (not well supported yet).
</details></li>

<h3 id="case2togglebuttons">Case #2 - Toggle Buttons</h3>
<p>Some questions for you to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>What makes a button, a button?</li>
<li>What's the difference between a button and an input checkbox/radio?</li>
<li>When you interact with these elements, do you expect the action to be taken immediately, or not?</li>
</ul>
<p>Give it some thought‚Ä¶</p>
<p><details>
<summary>Tips about dynamic names and states</summary></p>
<p>When we interact with "Sound toggle" using a screen reader, two things happen when pressing it:</p>
<ul>
<li>The button label changes</li>
<li>The <code>aria-pressed</code> values changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a screen reader, changing both <em>name</em> and <em>status</em> can be confusing when the toggle is not active.</p>
<ul>
<li>Voice Over: <em>selected, Sound on, toggle button</em></li>
<li>Voice Over: <em>unselected, Sound off, toggle button</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If the "sound off" is "unselected", it means the sound is actually turned on. Confusing right?</p>
<p>Here's an example, much clear for screen readers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Voice Over: <em>selected, Enable sound, toggle button</em></li>
<li>Voice Over: <em>unselected, Enable sound, toggle button</em></li>
</ul>
<p>üçÄ When labeling dynamic elements, never change both label and state at the same time. Stick with one of them.</p>
<p></details></p>
<p><details>
<summary>Tips about moments of actions</summary></p>
<p>One of the differences between a form control and a button is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Form controls (e.g. inputs) are meant to receive and carry a value. These values are editable and should not take effect until we explicit submit them.</li>
<li>Buttons are expected to take immediate action upon activation.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's the main question we should ask ourselves when building an interactive element:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the selection, takes immediate effect? Then, it's a button.</li>
<li>Does the selection requires confirmation? Then it's a form control.</li>
</ul>
<p>üçÄ The way a funcionality is presented might misslead us to change its foundations. We need to be mindful about this thin layer between UX and semantics.</p>
<p></details></p>
<p><details>
<summary>Tips about keyboard navigation</summary></p>
<p>Although <code>Tab</code> is the main way to navigate between interactive elements, it's not the only one. In some cases the navigation is done with arrow keys (e.g <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> radio/checkboxes). We can even create our custom shortcuts.</p>
<p>We might ask: When to use Tabs or Arrow Keys?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#kbd_shortcuts">WAI keyboard guidelines</a> are extended and a continuos work in progress. This is my current simplified decision tree:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skip Tabs to make navigation more efficient. (Google Drive is a great example)</li>
<li>Use Arrow keys when elements are directly related (eg a toolbox,a breadcrumb)</li>
<li>When using Arrow keys, highligh visually the parent element, for a clear understanding of the context and related elements.</li>
<li>The direction mechanism to move between elements depends on the context. <code>aria-describedby</code> with instructions can be helpful for blind people.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="case2clickablecards">Case #2 - Clickable cards</h3>
<p>You notice the cards are totally clickable - with touch, mouse and keyboard. Some things for you to consider:</p>
<p>Try to read it with screen reader‚Ä¶.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you jump directly to the title and keep reading, you won't notice the video category/date.</li>
<li>Does the date announcement sound right?</li>
<li>Try to highlight the card text. (eg select and copy the title). Could you do it?</li>

<h3 id="case4customselect">Case #4 - Custom select</h3>
<p>A custom accessible <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> is one of the hardest things to create.</p>
<p>Among many studies (read references below) around selects, I can give you the short answer: <strong>Avoid selectors if you can</strong>. But let‚Äôs face reality: a custom select is still our best solution sometimes.</p>
<p>There's a relative simple technique to enhance these custom selects. I personally named this a <em>"hybrid select"</em>. It consists of 2 selects:</p>
<ul>
<li>A native select, visible and accessible by default</li>
<li>A custom select, hidden until it‚Äôs safe to be interacted with a mouse</li>
</ul>
<p>The trick is to show each one at the right moment:</p>
<pre><code class="css language-css">/* show the custom select only on devices with hovers (aka mouse) */

.selectCustom {
  display: none;
}
@media (hover: hover) {
  .selectCustom {
    display: block;
  }

  /* In a computer, but using the keyboard?
  Then hide the custom select when the native is focused: */
  .selectNative:focus + .selectCustom {
    display: none;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> This still has A11Y issues. It's a partial solution of a bigger <a href="https://css-tricks.com/striking-a-balance-between-native-and-custom-select-elements/">"hybrid select" experiment</a>. If you use this in the future, please take into consideration its limitations.</p>
