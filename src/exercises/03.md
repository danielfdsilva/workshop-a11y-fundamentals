# 02. Meaningful images

## Motivation

_"One image is worth a thousand words."_ They say. What if you can't see the image?

Images make content way easier to understand for many people, AND in particular for those with cognitive and learning disabilities.

However, images can create major barriers when they are not accessible. Accessible images are beneficial in many situations, especially for people with visual dificulties and also for SEO.

There are [multiple concepts of images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images): Informative, decorative, functional, etc... and each one has particular "rules" to how best describe them.

## Exercise

We have a page with 4 visual representations about music, but none of it is accessible.
We know every `<img>` should have an `alt` attribute, but it's not used equally everywhere. In depends of its purpose. Sometimes leaving it empty `alt=""` is totally fine.

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal:** Add the necessary accessible descriptions to each image.

**Tip:** Try to replace the image `src` with an invalid url and see how the browser renders a broken image based on the `alt` attribute value.

## Notes

**Watch out how a webpage renders without images:** Sometimes the internet is slow and it takes time to load the image. Some people, prefer to disable images loading on mobile by default to save bandwidth data. Make sure the page looks good when this happens. A great opportunity for developers and designers collaborate!
