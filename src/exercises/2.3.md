# 2.3. Navigation Shortcuts

## Introduction

Many sites have a lot of links at the top of the page before the actual main content.

All these links force the people using keyboard-only to tab through every single link before they can reach or interact with the main content. We, as web creators, can make better than that, right?

A common simple pattern to bypass this is to create "Skip Navigation Links". The basic concept involves two elements: A _trigger_ and a _target_.

```html
<!-- Trigger: a link pointing to an #id -->
<a href="#main" class="skipLink">Skip to main content</a>

<!-- Target: A part of the page with the same id -->
<!-- Some browser will focus only if tabindex="-1" is used -->
<main id="main">
  ...
</main>
```

Making these links always visible can be ugly, so usually thse are visually hidden by default and shown when focused.

```css
.skipLink {
  /* hide visually the link */
  opacity: 0;
  /* make it unreachable by mouse */
  pointer-events: none;
}

.skipLink:focus {
  /* show the link on focus */
  opacity: 1;
}
```

## Exercise

In the exercise page, similar to the previous one, let's create some "Skip" links to jump directly to the main of the page and the footer.

**ðŸŽ¯ Goal:** Create navigation shortcuts through the page.
